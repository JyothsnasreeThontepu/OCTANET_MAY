                <p>
                    The open air has a bracing effect on the mind. The congestion of the city, the uproar and tumult, the intolerable noise of traffic, the depressing daily routine all are forgotten and the mind is at liberty. We then feel like running, leaping, singing and laughing.
                    How merrily we travel mile after mile in the company of friends. Hiking takes us near the beauties of nature. The sight of wild flowers, streams, trees and bushes is pleasing. A contact is established between us and nature.
                    We have no worries, no fear of the examination and no anxiety about the home task. We have got leisure to stand, to walk and talk. It is all the more a pleasure to do hiking in a mountainous region and thrilling than in the plains.
                    The excitement of climbing up to the top of a hill, the adventure of climbing down a slope, a grandeur of sunset behind a mountain, above us these impart a rare charm and interest to our journey. We walk among a zig-zag motor road or cut across a mountain path in search of adventure.  
                    We may have bright sunny weather or be caught by a sharp shower of rain. We may look below us into the yawning chasm or up at the peak of mountain. The feeling of unlimited freedom makes our hearts leap with joy. Hiking is one of the healthiest sports.

        <h3 class="section__subheader">HIKING ESSENTIALS</h3>
        <h2 class="section__header">Picking the right hiking gear!</h2>
        <p>

            These items should always be on your hiking checklist:

Hiking pack
Weather-appropriate clothing (think moisture-wicking and layers)
Hiking footwear
Plenty of food
Plenty of water
Navigation tools such as a map and compass
First-aid kit
Knife or multi-tool

 A small pack is the primary piece of gear for day hiking. You have several options for shorter hikes, from a simple bottle sling that frees your hands to a small daypack for snacks and your phone. For a longer outing, consider a 10- to 20-liter daypack that can hold those snacks and phone as well as extra layers, a first-aid kit and more. Learn more about choosing a daypack.
         Daypack (Choose one: bottle sling, waist pack, daypack, hydration pack)
            First step: Check the forecast. For warm and sunny days, consider how much protection your clothing will provide against the sun's ultraviolet rays while still keeping you cool. For rain and possible inclement weather, pack an extra layer or two beyond what you're wearing. And don't overlook being comfortableâ€”this experience is all about movement, so consider what clothing helps you feel secure while you're stepping, stretching and climbing. Learn more about choosing hiking clothing.
Moisture-wicking underwear
Moisture-wicking shirt
Quick-drying pants/shorts
Long-sleeve shirt (for sun, bugs)
Lightweight fleece or jacket
Socks (synthetic or wool)

        <h3 class="section__subheader">WHERE YOU GO IS THE KEY</h3>
        <h2 class="section__header">Understanding your map & timing</h2>
        <p>
Firstly, take some time to orientate yourself with the map and your planned route. This means finding north and then matching what you see on the ground with what is represented on the map.
Once you have oriented yourself, take a look at the legend (this is usually found in the bottom right-hand corner of the map). This will explain all of the symbols used on the map, which will be helpful in interpreting what you're looking at, especially if you're looking for the fastest route to the pub!
Pay attention to the contour lines as these show elevation changes and can help you visualise the shape of the land. If they're really tight together, that means the slope is really steep and you may wish to circumnavigate that big slope instead!
Another important feature to look out for are grid lines, which criss-cross the map and can be used to pinpoint your location (they usually intersect at points called "grid references"). This helps you break up the features you see around you and know exactly where you are.
Finally, make sure you're aware of any dangers that might be represented on the map, such as cliffs, fast-flowing rivers or steep slopes or impassable routes. There's nothing more depressing when out for an active hike and finding yourself 5 miles down a track, that you need to circle back on your hike, to get where you wanted to go.
